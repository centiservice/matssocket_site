MatsSocket currently have two clients, one for JavaScript/TypeScript, and one for Dart, working with Flutter.

The Dart client is a manual transpilation of the JavaScript client, and they are identical in functionality
as far as possible.

The JavaScript/TypeScript client is found at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matssocket), and its JSDoc resides
here.

The Dart/Flutter client is found at [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/matssocket).
