MatsSocket currently have two clients, one for JavaScript/TypeScript, and one for Dart, working with Flutter.

The Dart client is a manual transpilation of the JavaScript client, and they are identical in functionality
as far as possible. _(Thanks to [St√•le Undheim](https://github.com/staale) for this work, as well as setting up
test harnesses and testing-at-build for JS and Dart)_

The JavaScript/TypeScript client is found at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matssocket), and its JSDoc resides
[here](/codedoc/jsclient/0.19/MatsSocket.html).

The Dart/Flutter client is found at [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/matssocket).
