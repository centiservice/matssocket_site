MatsSocket documentation is evolving. There should be enough to get you going.

### CodeDoc: JavaDoc and JSDoc

MatsSocket have pretty extensive [Code Documentation](/codedoc/), so when you need something from the Client or Server
APIs, that's where you want to go.

### Documentation @ matssocket.io

Step through the navigation pane to the left! [Start here!](/docs/mats3-over-websocket) This is meant to be a guided
introduction to what MatsSocket is.

### Documentation @ MatsSocket repo

There's some documentation at the MatsSocket repo, notably the
[README.md](https://github.com/centiservice/matssocket#readme). However, that text is also largely ported here.

### Tests @ MatsSocket repo

Many of the Client tests should be instructive. The main JavaScript test file is
[this](https://github.com/centiservice/matssocket/blob/main/matssocket-client-javascript/tests_esm/src/all_tests.js),
which includes the actual files with tests. For Dart, the test files are
[here](https://github.com/centiservice/matssocket/tree/main/matssocket-client-dart/test), also swept up and run during
build.

The JavaScript tests are run in Node.js during build, but they are also possible to run in a browser.

### Reach out!

Feel free to contact me if you wonder about anything! _(It would make sense to first having skimmed through the
provided documentation!)_

Any suggestions wrt. the documentation is highly appreciated.
