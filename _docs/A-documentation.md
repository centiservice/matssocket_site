MatsSocket documentation is evolving. There should be enough to get you going.

### CodeDoc: JavaDoc and JSDoc

MatsSocket have pretty extensive [Code Documentation](/codedoc/), so when you need something from the Client or Server
APIs, that's where you want to go.

### Documentation @ mats3.io

Step through the navigation pane to the left! [Start here!](/docs/mats3-over-websocket) This is meant to be a guided
introduction to what MatsSocket is. There's not much more on this site yet.

### Documentation @ Mats<sup>3</sup> repo

This is currently where most of the prose documentation resides. First, you should read the
repo [README.md](https://github.com/centiservice/matssocket#readme).

### Reach out!

Feel free to contact me if you wonder about anything! _(It would make sense to first having skimmed through the
provided documentation!)_

Any suggestions wrt. the documentation is highly appreciated.
