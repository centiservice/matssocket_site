There are two sets of JavaDoc: A "classic" made with JDK 8, which still have the beloved JavaDoc frameset, and a
"modern" made with the most recent JDK LTS version, lacking the frameset, but with better search.

Both of these contain all the Mats subpackages.

In addition, there is JavaDoc for the Mats<sup>3</sup> API alone (modern style). This should be useful when
familiarizing oneself with how Mats works, reducing the noise from support-, utility- and test classes.
