     * JSR 356 WebSocket API for Java sends GOING_AWAY upon socket close due to timeout. Since a timeout can happen
     * if we loose connection and thus can't convey PINGs, the MatsSocketServer must not interpret Jetty's
     * timeout-close as Close Session. Likewise, if the client just experienced massive lag on the connection, and
     * thus didn't get the PING over to the server in a timely fashion, but then suddenly gets Jetty's timeout close
     * with GOING_AWAY, this should not be interpreted by the client as the server wants to close the session.
